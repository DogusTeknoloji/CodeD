### Main Agenda

### Key Discussions and Decisions

   - Discussed the complexity of new C# features and their impact on team coding standards.

3. **ID and Key Management:**

   - Implemented logic to parse IDs as GUIDs or treat them as keys if parsing fails.

4. **External Reference Update Logic:**

5. **HTTP PUT Method Adjustments:**
   - Allowed both ID-based and ID-less PUT requests by modifying method attributes.
